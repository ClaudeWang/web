Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?

I think eshtaartha's semantic web lab is very polished. The tool
that he used for presentation looks very new to me and it looks
great. Also, his presentaion follows a line of thoughts that
was presented well with his video. It just makes the style of the
presentation more consistent.

Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?

I really like the webGL personally. I have not used webGL for
web graphics. He provided some easy-to-comprehend concepts enough
for starting off a simple project. I mainly learned how to use
webGL as a cavas and how to render different shapes with the module.

Which talk did you like the best and why?

I like the discussion of typescript. I think it is useful to know
about this because it addresses some issues that we did not cover
during the semester. I also agree with him on that strictly typed
languages suit bigger projects better. I also like his discussion
on javascript's problems. It is this kind of talk that makes us
think about the pros and cons of what we learned in class.
