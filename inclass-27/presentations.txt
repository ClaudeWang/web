Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?

I thinks Chao Zhou's presentation is very polished. He gave an overview
of the current mobile app industry and stated the trend of using hybrid
apps over native apps. On the other hand, I like Zheng Zhang's live demo.
It was brave to have a live demo with a 5-minute cap in the first place.
And I think it is cool that he showed how easy it was to make an animation.

Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?

I learned most from the mobile topic. It seems like nowadays everyting is
developed mobile only. This was made possible by the different frameworks
available on the market. There are multiple talks that touch on different
ways mobile apps have advanced.

Which talk did you like the best and why?

I like prakhar doshi's proressive web apps. First of all, the presentation
is very well-polished with the help of the tool. Second, I think he addressed
some solutions and issues of modern web apps and where web apps will be heading.
I think I could benefit a lot from learning the things he talked about.
