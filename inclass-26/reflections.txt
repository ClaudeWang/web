What did you hope to learn but did not?

I basically learned everything I expected to learn in this class.
It would be nice to cover some network basics, but I guess this is
outside the scope of the class.

What did you really enjoy learning about?

I really enjoy learning about building the dynamically rendered pages.
It was less intuitive at the beginning but I ended up finding it the
coolest thing that I learned in this class. Additionally, I think
learning about using different services to host our own website is also
cool.

What worked well in the course? and how?

I think the professor is very responsible and the assignment is extremely
useful considering we continously improved it and added stuff to it. I
also like how it is teaching the most up-to-date technology.

What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?

I feel like there is not enough support for inclass assignments. Dr. Pollack
is always helpful during class. However, if we were stuck on a problem, the
long line for waiting for one's turn to ask a question is very intimidating.
I hope in the future there could be more in-class TAs who could provide more
help.

What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of
in class exercises, goals of projects -and be specific please!

I would say the inclass assignments are really useful but frustrating as well.
Sometimes the material covered in class was not enough to finish the in class
exercises. Most of the time is wasted on googling runtimer errors and waiting
in line to understand the problem from the very beginning. This could've been
much easier if there was less general introduction and more in-depth analysis
of sample code.

Anything else you like to say?
Yeah! Thanks for the great efforts to organize the class!
